# medical-data-parser

Medical Data Parser is an application which stores medical information about patients (name, blood
groups, symptoms) and associations between symptoms and diseases in XML/JSON format. The
application has a desktop interface implemented in Java Swing which allows: searching patients
compatible for a certain patient specified in case of a blood transfusion, diagnosing patients based on
symptoms and displaying different information stored in documents (name of doctors and their
specialization, patients with blood group and symptoms, the diagnosis rules). Inside of the Java project I
implemented unit tests that check if the GUI components behave as expected under diverse use cases.
